# Project Instructions for Claude

## Git Workflow
- Always push directly to the main branch. Do NOT create pull requests.
- Always update README and push to git after every discussion.
- Any changes MUST be updated in the README AND pushed to git AND deployed immediately after making them. Pushing to main IS deployment — GitHub Actions picks up the latest code on every scheduled run.
- Never leave changes uncommitted or unpushed at the end of a task.
